another attempt at minecraft

go server for all the requests
    handshakes via connections. udp
        in the net pkg
        establish conn then each conn gets a goroutine?
        since handshakes are stored in memory. store em in memory
    sqlite server setup
        some framework
        player {
            name string,
            pos []int,
            online bool or nil/handshake
        }
        chunk{}
        block{}
    research sending data over a server as structs instead of json
        cpp connect and test sending json and structs to udp servers
    the actual routes

cpp use zmq for a client
    in udp

cpp game in sdl(sfml for now?)


actual chunk rendering and mesh system?





note: on the client side, the player continuously moves and does stuff, meanwhile, it updates the server on another thread and corrects the player if its position is inaccurate
