go server:
    post_chunk_updates ignores the player who sent data
    prevents players from moving faster than legally possible
    database issues
        performance
        "too many open files"
    seed for each world
        randomly determined by the server on first start?
    security/optimizations
        tick system(TPS)?
        header is reduced to bytes (less overhead)
            method: byte (methods can just be numbered?)
            success: bool
            id: byte/short
            timestamp: short?
                server time?
        ignores ddosing stuffs


cpp client:
    test client
        graphics
    routes and communications with the server
    perlin noise testing
        colour based on: seed, x, y
        height: seed, x, y, colour      // shrink 4 vars into 1?
    multithreading review
        comm with server
        render
        generation?
    terrain
        biomes:
            mushroom fields, plains, desert, tundra
        height:
            valley, flat, mountains
    cmake: net lib is built upon building any executable
    seperate home/game screens?
        if logged_in, show game screen, else home
        

note:
    on the client side, the player continuously moves and does stuff, meanwhile, it updates the server on another thread and corrects the player if its position is inaccurate
    chunks are a map that are edited on another thread. rendering thread just draws em

post, get chunks and post_chunk_updates(both ways) are all sent in binary.
    client recieving simply appends to existing chunk data

    server verifies if the address is in Addys
    and then checks player position.
        chunk in render dist?
            yes: update sql
            no: ignore
