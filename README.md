### Building
- coming soon!

### Todo
- Finish up the server
  - handshakes
  - routes
  - security/optimizations(TPS system/server time)
- Client start
  - send certain bytes in a request
  - communicating and handshakes via UDP
  - async all of that
  - optimizations(requests every tick, not frame)
